Description: A new powerful test is proposed to compare AUCs under two correlated ROC curves based on an unbiased variance estimator derived from U statistic theory. The variance, confidence interval of a single ROC curve, the covariance of two ROC curves, and the confidence interval of the AUC difference can also be computed within this package. In addition, this package includes a function to generate correlated risk scores in case-control setting.
